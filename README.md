# FÎ”T MIDI Controller: The Phone 
This project demonstrates a basic MIDI controller done with Arduino UNO clone. The controller sends basic MIDI data so it can be used with any software that accepts MIDI. I'm using Ableton Live 9 myself. I like the ability to map my MIDI commands to basically anything.

## Few words about MIDI

This dude [*darran*](http://hunt.net.nz/users/darran/weblog/5b7f8/Arduino_UNO_USB_MIDI_firmware.html) has made a great USB MIDI driver for atmega8u2, among other interesting things.  

Original Uno firmware needs to be flipped with that driver. I did the flippin' with [Atmels FLIP progammer](http://www.atmel.com/tools/flip.aspx?tab=overview).

Flipping is a minor headache, because to test the code you'll need to flip the firmware and to again modfiy code you'll need to flip the original Arduino firmware back. It's alright since you can develop the code pretty much just by staring at the serial monitor once you understand how MIDI works.

The MIDI messages are sent serially over USB at 115200 baud. They can be modified and created in midi_messages.h file. The basic message that's sent is four bytes long.

```
Byte 0: MIDI Command
  e.g Note Off: 1000nnnn, e.g. 0x80
      Note On:  1001nnnn, e.g. 0x90
Byte 1: MIDI Channel from 1 to 16
Byte 2: MIDI Data Byte 2
Byte 3: MIDI Data Byte 3
```

These data bytes depend on the command. For Note On/Off they're pitch and velocity values.
And for Control Change they're Control Number and Control Value.

The serial message might look something like this:
```
1001000 00000001 00001100 01000000 
= 0x90 0x01 0x0c 0x40
= Note On, Channel 1, Note 12 (C1), velocity 64
```

Got it? So you can develop your own messages by checking the MIDI specification.

### So what did I do?

My controller has 12 pushbuttons. Notes are in chromatic scale, since 
this is inteded to be used as a drum pad. Obviously you can play some melodies
or even chords as well. There are also two buttons to change octave and a pot 
that is used for control changes (CC48).

I installed the UNO to an old office telephone. I used old PCB inside and made use of
the neat pushbutton pad. Just had to solder few old components away and make new connections.

At first I kept UNO separate from The Phone. My idea was to use it as a part of a bigger
controller family that would be controlled by only one UNO. I made a hole into the back 
and screwed a 10 pin ribbon connector in it. 

The result looked hideous and finally fitted the whole UNO inside the chassis. At least it's
now simple and neat, but I feel like I'm wasting a lot of UNO's potential with this few controls. 

I'm still planning to make a bigger controller hub some of these days.
